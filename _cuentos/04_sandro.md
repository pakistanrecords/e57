––Pregúntale a este pinche gringo que qué pedo con esas pinches llantas, se ven culerísimas ––said the man in the boots, white suit, Poncharello shades and cowboy hat, Sandro de Amecameca, when we arrived at the house in Sabinas where for some mysterious reason we were about to play a small gig for a few young people from the Partido Revolucionario Institucional as part of Pakistán's debut. His assistant, a diminutive man whose name I just can’t remember turned to me and somewhat translated his words, ignorant to the fact that I know my share of colorful and rustic north-eastern Mexican Spanish. Northern Gothic.  
––Mr. Sandro would like me to inquire you regarding the nature of the venue’s decoration ––he said, pointing at the tires hanging on the wall of the parking lot. I didn’t answer.  
I glanced to the other side of the parking lot (“the venue”) and saw don Tito blahbling with the Dueto Valle Zar about that which don Tito and the Dueto Valle Zar could blahble about. The Dueto were the most professional people I ever worked with during my time at Pakistán Records. For some reason Don Tito (or was it don Tito? I never knew) didn’t want to produce their records, so it was me (assisted by Fran, of course) pulling the faders and pushing the buttons at their sessions. We had their first song ready to mix in less than thirty minutes. And we are talking about some old guys who used to play on buses during the day and bounced from cantina to congal to cantina at night.  
Those were the days.  
––¿Y dónde chingados están los pinches músicos que les encargué? Seguro van a traer a cualquier pendejo que ni ensayó mis rolas”, Sandro asked.  
––Mr. Sandro is worried about the absence and slash or technical capabilities of the backing band he required.  
––They should arrive any moment now ––I answered––. Don’t worry, Mr. Sandro, no preocupado, todo OK, todo OK”, I said, showing two thumbs up and smiling unnaturally. I guess he looked judgmentally at me, from somewhere beyond the blackness of his oversized shades.  
We stood awkwardly waiting for Fran Baxter. He had gone to pick up the band, their instruments and other equipment with his old VW Type 2, aka the Pakisván. After almost one hour of Sandro’s whining and his assistant’s “translations”, the Pakisván arrived at the parking lot.  
Fran Baxter entered the big garden with one shabby looking guy on each side: The Nebulosos. I had thought they were supposed to be like seven guys.  
They were already carrying their instruments: a guitar and a metal chain.  
––¿Estos son los puñetas con los que voy a tocar? ––asked Sandro from the top of his lungs.  
––Mr. Sandro wants to know if this is going to be his backing band during his concert ––asked Sandro’s assistant, walking hastily towards me.  
––Yeah ––I said––, they are going to play by themselves first.  
The assistan translated that and Sandro seemed pleased for the first time since I had met him. Sooner than later the band was plugged in, hopefully in tune, and ready to play. They seemed high as fuck. While they were plugging in Fran went to the Pakisván and came back with a plastic supermarket bag full of brand SM57, about fifteen of them.  
––Cuídalos un chingo, Vikinguito ––said Fran Baxter giving me the bag-o-mikes.  
––Guess who’s coming! Guess who’s coming! ––screamed one of the Nebulosos on the stage. Pakistán Records birth was imminent. And what a birth it was.
